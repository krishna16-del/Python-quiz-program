🎯 Overview
This is a simple, command-line-based General Knowledge Quiz implemented in Python. It presents the user with five multiple-choice questions, accepts their answers, provides immediate feedback, and calculates a final score based on performance.

✨ Features
1.Five Multiple-Choice Questions: Covers topics in science and general trivia.

2.Immediate Feedback: Tells the user "CORRECT!" or "INCORRECT!" after each guess.

3.Answer Display: Reveals the correct answer if the user guesses incorrectly.

4.Final Results Summary: Displays the correct answers, the user's guesses, and a final score expressed as a percentage.

⚙️ How to Run the Code
1.Save the file: Save the provided Python code as a .py file (e.g., quiz.py).

2.Open your terminal or command prompt.

3.Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

4.Run the script using the Python interpreter:

5.Follow the prompts: The quiz will start, and you will be asked to enter your choice (A, B, C, or D) for each question.

2.Which animal lays the largest eggs?

3.What is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere?

4.How many bones are in the human body?

5.Which planet in the solar system is the hottest?

🛠️ Code Structure
1.The code utilizes basic Python data structures to manage the quiz:

2.questions (Tuple): Stores the text of the questions.

3.options (Tuple of Tuples): Stores the four answer choices for each question.

4.answers (Tuple): Stores the correct letter ('A', 'B', 'C', or 'D') for each question.

The main logic is handled by a for loop that iterates through the questions and manages user input and scoring.

🚀 Next Steps (Possible Enhancements)
1.Expansion: Add more questions to the quiz.

2.Data Structure: Refactor the quiz content into a list of dictionaries for easier management and expansion.

3.Input Validation: Add checks to ensure the user only enters valid options (A, B, C, D).

4.Difficulty Levels: Implement different difficulty settings for question sets.# Python-quiz-program
